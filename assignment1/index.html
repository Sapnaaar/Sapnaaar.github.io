    <h3>Palat Tuntaopas Portfolio website</h3>

    <h3>
      What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
      experience?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The first thing I paid attention to is the 4 division cursor effect where
      the cursor acts as the centre of 4 divisions, and when the cursor passes
      over certain words, it then changes accordingingly to the direction in
      which you move the cursor, whilst each division is distinct with its on
      distinct colour. This was eye catching as it was a unique effect that I
      had never interacted with before and through its uniqueness it encourage
      user interaction by encouraging users to explore the different variations
      of sentences and words that change as the user moves the mouse around.
    </p>

    <img class="image2" src="image2.png" alt="screenshot 2" />
    <img class="image3" src="image3.png" alt="screenshot 3" />

    <h3>
      Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
      discrete actions.
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Moving cursor around and watching as colours and words moved accordingly
        with the direction of cursor movement
      </li>
      <li>
        Scrolling vertically to next section - moving cursor up/down/around to
        see how the triangle moves accordingly
      </li>
      <li>Moving cursor around the 'pixel displacement effect'</li>
      <li>
        Moving cursor and hovering over text which prompts a visual
        effect/animation for the text to occur
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I most enjoyed the cursor displacement effect' which requires the user to
      move the cursor around a box of pixels where the cursor moved the pixels
      around accordingly in a circular distorted way. This was the most engaging
      part of the site for me as a user as it was unique and unlike other
      features I had experienced on websites before and it served a fun and
      interactive purpose to entertain users.
    </p>

    <!-- <img class="image4" src="image4.png" alt="screenshot 4" /> -->

    <!-- <div class="pixel"> -->

    <!-- I initially attempted to place image and text side by side and so I created div classes to group certain texts and adjust their width and size in order to place a text next to it - however in the end I didnt keep this in as I liked the visual layout of  images lined up next to each other horizontally between text as I felt it had a cleaner and more organised look -->
    <h3>
      What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
      experience?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The cursor was a major element in interactive elements within the website,
      and thus one of the main actions I undertook was moving the cursor around
      in circles and exploring each area in what it presents. This involved
      moving the cursor around in the 4 division effect and reading the text
      multiple times as words changed and moving the cursor around through the
      pixel displacement effect. There were also animations and effects embedded
      into text when the mouse hovers over the words towards the bottom of the
      page which included the developer's name and various forms of contacts
      which were activiated when the mouse hovers over the text, further
      emphasising on the frequent and vital use of the cursor in ways that didnt
      involve just scrolling.
    </p>

    <h3>
      What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
      experience?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I believe the intended goal here was for the web designer/developer to
      showcase their design and interactive development abilities to a wide
      range of users that may preferably be clients. The developer aims to
      present various unique and engaging features throughout the experience and
      journey of the website to not only present their skills but to also engage
      and entertain users whilst leaving a memorable and lasting impression.
    </p>

    <img class="image4" src="image4.png" alt="screenshot 4" />
    <img class="image6" src="image6.png" alt="screenshot 6" />

    <h3>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
    <p>
      The web page features various unique features and aspects that display the
      web developer's skill and creativity in web development. Such unique
      features involved high levels of repeated interactivity which encouraged
      users to repeatedly moving the cursor around the web page in order to
      actively interact with varying elements such as the ones previously
      mentioned. Through this the developer displays their abilities of creating
      engagement.
    </p>

    <h3>
      What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
      over time? (For how long and how many different times)
    </h3>
    <p>
      The features on this web page will encourage users to repeatedly interact
      with the webpage numerous times in a temporary manner. The developer
      especially utilises user interactivity as a core aspect of features such
      as the 4 division cursor effect where the user is required to move the
      cursor around in four directions in order to unveil all the different
      variations of the sentences present. The colour that changes with it is
      also visually engaging and encourages the user to continue interacting
      with the feature even after reading all variations. The pixel displacement
      effect also solely relies on user interactivity to the extent of their
      engagement. These features are overall engaging in a temporary and
      recreational manner.
    </p>

    <h3>
      How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
      interacted with over time?
    </h3>
    <p>
      This website can be a point of reference for possible clients to look back
      at consider the web developer as an artist to be hired by possible
      clients. The website was not built in mind to offer services that can be
      run through the site, instead it serves purpose as a mini portfolio that
      showcases the abilities the developer possesses that can be offered to
      clients who are interested in the developer's services.
    </p>

    <h3>
      What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
      reference?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The pixel displacement effect can be referencing aspects of online games
      that aim to act as a fidget activity to make a user feel stimulated.
      Whilst the 4 division cursor effect with the changing nature of words can
      also be references to fill in the blank sentence games that can keep an
      audience guessing, a contemporary example being the game cards against
      humanity. The text animations present also bear resemblance to animations
      and quirks present within the cozy game genre, and thr aestehtics and
      animations are also similar to the one present in mobile games such as
      colour switch. And thus overall it seems the developer has referenced
      aspects of other existing forms of media that involve a sense of
      playfullness within them, which could be communicating a core aspect of
      their style and individuality present in their designs.

    <h3>
      What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
      when engaging with your research experience?
    </h3>

    <p>
      The fun nature of the features present within the website that aim to
      entertain and engage can indicate that the developer would have wanted
      users to act in a self-indulgent way when interacting with features.
      Especially communicated through references of playful elements in other
      forms of media. The website serves to be an amusing and enjoyable
      experience for casual audiences and professional clients alike and
      channels a sense of awe and playfulness for users to immerse themselves
      into.
    </p>

    <h3>
      What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel
      when engaging with your research experience?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The main aim by the developer would have been to make users feel
      entertained and feel a sense of awe and wonder when interacting with
      unique uncommon features that are not present or indicative of common
      contemporary commercial websites that users may frequently interact with.
      For example the presence of the pixel displacement effect allows users to
      interact with the feature in a self indulgent manner that makes them feel
      satisfied. References to playful aspects can also invoke a sense of
      nostalgia in the sense that they channel the amusement and desire to want
      to play around with and explore such creative and interactive features;
      packaged in a new and modern way.
    </p>

    <h3>
      What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes
      that part frustrating?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The most frustrating part of the website is that the use of such overly
      interactive and unique features can lead the website to be a bit laggy at
      times. Especially the text at the bottom of the page which involve options
      such as 'Email', 'Line' and Linkedin' which all have in built animations
      that occur when the mouse hovers over the text before the user can click
      on it. It can also make it hard to distinguish whether the text option is
      clickable as all the text including "Feel free to contact me" and
      clickable options such as 'Email' (etc.) are the same text size and font
      with it all having its own animation, thus making it hard for a user to
      navigate and identify the clickable aspects. The website also heavily
      relies on the movement of the mouse for such programmed and animated
      features to occur which may lead touch screen users to have a vastly
      different user experience.

    <img class="effect3" src="effect3.png" alt="effect 3" />
    <h3>
      What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes
      that part satisfying?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The animations on the text are visually appealing and engaging to interact
      it as the animation is programmed smoothly. However the text displacement
      effect is especially satisfying to interact with as its extremely engaging
      and entertaining and extremely well coded. Its a feature that is not much
      present commonly thus making it unique as users can repeatedly move the
      mouse around to observe as pixels move and distort according to user's
      movements.
