        <!-- Below are the functions for the main interactive elements of the media
          player which involve the play/pause, rewind and fast-forward, replay,
          mute/ un mute and full screen button options. These were vital for the
          site as they are key and prominent features for media players in order
          to allow users to watch the media and also be able to customise the
          experience according to their preferences. I placed the play/pause
          button first for it to be the “first” and main option the user can
          interact with, whilst the rewind and fast-forward buttons are placed
          next to do it as other predominant features the user can utilise
          whilst watching the media itself. The remaining buttons replay,
          mute/un-mute and full screen are then placed on the right side of the
          progress bar where I placed the replay button first so that it can
          visually be the first option that users consider in order to replay
          and continue consuming the media. -->

            the artist of the music video and the audience as it allows the
            audience to show their support and appreciation through the like

      <!-- Below is a previously failed attempt at the heart button. I am still not
        entirely sure why the code did not work but I decided to re-do by
        approaching it differently. I had initially watched youtube tutorials
        and articles which suggested using ‘getelementById in the javascript
        code and code the icons to change upon a click, however when I had
        attempted this one of the icons did not appear upon click and after
        numerous tries I was not able to solve the problem. So instead I changed
        the approach and programmed it to be more similar to what we had learnt
        in class by just using ‘const heartImg’ in the javascript code and
        linking the image through that. In the second approach I also made sure
        to rename the image files to ‘heart-outlined’ and ‘heart-filled’ to make
        it simpler and less convoluted. It ended up being a success in the end,
        although I’m still unsure about where it went wrong in the first attempt
        I believe it was wise to start over with a slightly different and more
        familiar approach - (refer to javascript file for the previous and now final attempts)-->
